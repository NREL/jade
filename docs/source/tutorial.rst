This page describes how to use the JADE package to create, modify, and run
jobs locally or on an HPC.

CLI Commands
============
All CLI commands documented in this page have a hierarchical nature. There are
group commands followed by subcommands. You can enter ``--help`` at any level.
For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ jade --help
    $ jade config --help
    $ jade config hpc --help


HPC Configuration
=================
This section only applies if you run your jobs on an HPC.

Change to a directory on the shared filesystem (such as /scratch on Eagle).
JADE uses the filesystem for internal synchronization.

HPC Parameters
--------------
You must define your HPC configuration in a settings file. Run this command
customized to your parameters.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ jade config hpc -a my-project -p short -t slurm -w "4:00:00" -c hpc.toml
    Created HPC config file hpc_config.toml

All parameters have defaults, and so you can run ``jade config hpc`` and then
edit the file afterwards.

The following parameters are optional when running on NREL's HPC (Eagle):

- ``partition``: If not specified then the HPC will decide the partition based
  on the wall time value (recommended unless you are using the `debug`
  partition).
- ``mem``: If specified then the HPC will only
  provide nodes that have at least this amount of memory.  Refer to the HPC
  documentation for supported formats. On Eagle: "80GB", "150GB".
- ``tmp``: If specified then the HPC will only provide nodes that have at least this
  amount of storage space as scratch space. Refer to the HPC documentation for
  supported formats. On Eagle: "500GB", "2TB".

JADE was primarily designed to maximize use of compute node CPUs when running
jobs that only require a single node. Given that objective, the default value
of ``nodes`` is ``1``.

JADE also supports setting ``nodes``, ``ntasks``, and ``ntasks_per_node`` to
allow users to run multi-node jobs. Refer to the HPC documentation and ensure
each job is compatible with the settings. Note that each job will be run on
every node simultaneously.

Refer to :ref:`multi_node_job_strategy` for an example of how to use JADE's
multi-node feature.

Refer to :ref:`model_slurm_config` for a full list of parameters available
on NREL's Eagle HPC with SLURM.

Submission Groups
-----------------
If you need different parameters for different jobs then you can separately
define submission groups in the configuration. Refer to
:ref:`submission_group_strategy` for more information.

Lustre Filesystem
-----------------
If you are running on a Lustre filesystem then you should consider whether to
configure the Lustre stripe count. This can be beneficial if the the files you
create will be large or if many clients will be accessing them concurrently.

References:

- http://wiki.lustre.org/Configuring_Lustre_File_Striping
- https://www.nics.tennessee.edu/computing-resources/file-systems/lustre-striping-guide

.. note::

   This example Lustre filesystem command will only work if the directory is
   empty.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ lfs setstripe -c 16 <run-directory>

Configuring Jobs
================
Create a text file with a list of commands, one per line.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat commands.txt
    bash my_script.sh ARG1
    bash my_script.sh ARG2

.. warning:: Commands are not run through a shell, so you cannot use special
   shell characters. You can workaround this by putting your command in a
   shell script.

Job Commands
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ jade config create commands.txt -c config.json
    Created configuration with 2 jobs.
    Dumped configuration to config.json.

JADE created ``config.json`` with one definition per job. You can edit this
file to customize execution behavior.

Refer to :ref:`model_generic_command_parameters` for a full list of
configurable parameters.

Job Ordering
------------
Each job defines a ``blocked_by`` field. If you want to guarantee that job ID
2 doesn't run until job ID 1 completes then add that ID to the field.

If a job that is blocking another job fails then JADE will still run the
blocked job by default. This may not be what you want. You can optionally set
``cancel_on_blocking_job_failure`` to cause those blocked jobs to be canceled.

.. code:: python

    {
      "command": "<job_cli_command1>",
      "job_id": 1,
      "blocked_by": []
    },
    {
      "command": "<job_cli_command2>",
      "job_id": 2,
      "blocked_by": [1]
    },
    {
      "command": "<job_cli_command3>",
      "job_id": 3,
      "blocked_by": [1]
      "cancel_on_blocking_job_failure": false
    },
    {
      "command": "<job_cli_command4>",
      "job_id": 4,
      "blocked_by": [2, 3],
      "cancel_on_blocking_job_failure": true
    }


Show Job Summary
----------------
In order to view a summary of your jobs in a table:

.. code:: bash

    $ jade config show config.json

    Num jobs: 4
    +-------+------+----------------+---------------------------+
    | index | name |    command     |   blocked_by (job names)  |
    +-------+------+----------------+---------------------------+
    |   0   |  1   | julia run.jl 1 |                           |
    |   1   |  2   | julia run.jl 2 |            1              |
    |   2   |  3   | julia run.jl 3 |            1              |
    |   3   |  4   | julia run.jl 4 |           2, 3            |
    +-------+------+----------------+---------------------------+

CLI Execution
=============
Jade provides a CLI utility to start jobs.

submit-jobs
-----------
Start execution of jobs defined in a configuration file.  If executed on HPC
this will submit the jobs to the HPC queue. Otherwise, it will run the jobs
locally.

It's important to understand how JADE submits HPC jobs in order to optimize
your performance.  JADE divides the jobs created by the user into batches.  It
makes one HPC node submission for each batch. Once running on a node it runs in
parallel a number of worker processes equal to the number of CPUs on that node
(36 on Eagle).

Parameters to keep in mind:

- **Number of jobs**: Number of jobs created by the user.
- **Max nodes**: Max number of job submissions (batches) to run in parallel.
  Default is unbounded.
- **Per-node batch size**: Number of jobs to run on one node in one batch.
- **Allocation time**: How long it takes to acquire a node. Dependent on the
  HPC queue chosen and the priority given.
- **Average job runtime**: How long it takes a job to complete.
- **HPC config file**: Customized HPC parameters like walltime and partition
- **Time-based batching**: If jobs have variable runtimes then it is better to
  define those runtimes in the config file and then use the
  ``--time-based-batching`` flag to let JADE create variable-sized batches.
  Mutually exclusive with --per-node-batch-size.

If the jobs have a short duration and it takes a long time to acquire a
node then you may want to maximize the value of per_node_batch_size. Conversely,
if the time to acquire a node is short then you can lower per_node_batch_size in
order to run on more nodes in parallel.

Refer to :ref:`submission_strategies` for a description of how to handle
specific use cases.

Note that you can set different parameters for different batches if you define
submission groups. Refer to :ref:`submission_group_strategy` for more
information.

.. note:: You can enable ``--dry-run`` to check how the batches will be created
   without actually submitting any jobs.

Examples::

    # Use defaults.
    $ jade submit-jobs config.json

    # Specify options.
    $ jade submit-jobs config.json \
        --output=output \
        --per-node-batch-size=500 \
        --hpc-config=hpc_config.toml

Run ``jade submit-jobs --help`` to see all command options and defaults.

To aid with repeated runs you can pass these parameters in a config file.
Generate the defaults with

.. code-block:: bash

    $ jade config submitter-params

    Created submitter parameter file submitter_params.toml

And then pass this file to ``submit-jobs``

.. code-block:: bash

    $ jade submit-jobs config.json -s submitter_params.toml

.. note::

   By default HPC nodes are requested at normal priority. Set qos=high in
   hpc_config.toml to get faster allocations at twice the cost.


Output Directory
----------------
JADE stores all of its configuration information and log files in the output
directory specified by the ``submit-jobs`` command. You can tell JADE to
forward this directory to the job CLI commands by setting the
``append_output_dir`` job parameter to true.

Suppose you submit jobs with

.. code-block:: bash

    jade submit-jobs config.json -o output

Where ``config.json`` contains a job definition like this:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "command": "bash my_script.sh",
      "job_id": 1,
      "blocked_by": [],
      "append_output_dir": true
    }

JADE will actually invoke this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bash my_script.sh --jade-runtime-output=output

This can be useful to collect all job outputs in a common location. JADE
automatically creates ``<output-dir>/job-outputs`` for this purpose.

Node setup and shutdown scripts
-------------------------------
When running on an HPC you might want to copy input files to each compute node
before running jobs and then upload output data afterwards. JADE provides
options to automate this process.

.. code-block:: bash

    jade submit-jobs --node-setup-script="python setup_node.py" --node-shutdown-script="python shutdown_node.py" config.json

In this example JADE will invoke these commands on each compute node.

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup_node.py config_batch1.json output-dir
    python shutdown_node.py config_batch1.json output-dir

Note the arguments:

1. JADE config file for that node's batch. It contains only the jobs in the
   batch.
2. the output directory passed to ``jade submit-jobs``

You can use this information to decide what files to copy. Here is an example
of how to use it.

Pre-requisite: define required files for each in each job's ``ext`` field.

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "command": "bash my-script.sh",
      "job_id": 1,
      "blocked_by": [],
      "extension": "generic_command",
      "ext": {"required_files": ["/projects/X/input_data.json"]}
    }

Here is what you can do in the setup script.

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    import shutil
    import sys
    from pathlib import Path

    from jade.jobs.job_configuration_factory import create_config_from_file

    config_file = sys.argv[1]
    config = create_config_from_file(config_file)
    required_files = set()
    for job in config.iter_jobs():
        required_files.update(set(job.ext.get("required_files", [])))

    work_dir = os.environ["LOCAL_SCRATCH"]  # or whatever is appropriate for your environment
    for filename in required_files:
        shutil.copyfile(filename, Path(work_dir) / os.path.basename(filename))


.. note:: You can define different setup/shutdown scripts for different jobs if
   you define submission groups.

Job Execution
=============

HPC
---
The job submitter runs in a distributed fashion across the login node and all
compute nodes that get allocated.

1. User initiates execution by running ``jade submit-jobs`` on the login node.
2. JADE submits as many batches as possible and then exits. Jobs can be blocked
   by ordering requirements or the user-specified max-node limit.
3. HPC queueing system allocates a compute node for a batch of jobs and starts
   the JADE job runner process.
4. Both before and after running a batch of jobs the job runner will run
   ``jade try-submit-jobs``. If it finds newly-unblocked jobs then it will
   submit them in a new batch. This will occur on every allocated compute node.
5. When a submitter detects that all jobs are complete it will summarize
   results and mark the configuration as complete.

The JADE processes synchronize their activity with status files and a file lock
in the output directory.

Refer to :ref:`distributed_submission_workflow` for a diagram of this process.

Local
-----
JADE runs all jobs at the specified queue depth until they all complete.

Job Status
===========
While jobs are running you can check status with this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ jade show-status -o output

The status is updated when each compute node starts or completes its execution
of a batch, so this status may not be current.

Every job runner will log completions to the same file, so you can see live job
completions with this command. Note that this file is cleared each time a
submitter processes it.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tail -F output/results.csv

Check processed jobs in this file:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Find out how many have completed.
    $ wc -l output/processed_results.csv

    # Follow updates.
    $ tail -f output/processed_results.csv


Every submitter will log to the same file, so you can monitor submission status
with this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tail -f output/submit-jobs.log

You can also trigger a full status update by manually trying to submit new
jobs.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ jade try-submit-jobs output
    $ jade show-status -o output


Canceling Jobs
==============
You can cancel all jobs running in a submission with this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ jade cancel-jobs output


Job Results
===========
Once execution is complete you can view the results of the jobs.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ jade show-results --output=output

Or only the ones that failed

.. code-block:: bash

    $ jade show-results --failed

Failed or Missing Jobs
======================
If some jobs fail because of a walltime timeout or code/data error then you can
resubmit those specific jobs without re-running all the jobs that passed.

Jobs that timeout will be reported as missing.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ jade resubmit-jobs --missing --failed output

.. note:: This command is currently not supported in local mode.

Debugging
=========
By default JADE generates report files that summarize what happened. Refer to
``results.txt``, ``errors.txt``, ``stats.txt``, and ``stats_summary.json``.
The results file shows whether each job passed or failed.  The errors file
shows unhandled errors that JADE detected as well as known errors that it
parsed from log files.

Here are the log files that JADE generates. Open these to dig deeper.

- ``submit_jobs.log``: HPC-related information, such as the job ID and status
- ``run_jobs.log``: information about JADE starting and stopping jobs
- ``job_output_<HPC job ID>.e``: The HPC logs stdout and stderr from all
  processes to this file. Look here to debug unexpected crashes or hangs.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ find output -name "*.log" -o -name "*.e"
    output/J1__3__1.15__1.0__deployment1.dss/logs/deployment1.dss_simulation.log
    output/J1__3__1.15__1.0__deployment1.dss/pydss-project/Logs/pydss-project_deployment1.dss.log
    output/submit_jobs.log
    output/job_output_1151157.e

Python crashes will print ``Traceback`` to stderr, so that is a good string
to search for.

SLURM error strings:  ``srun``, ``slurmstepd``, ``DUE TO TIME LIMIT``

Useful grep commands

.. code-block:: bash

    $ grep "WARNING\|ERROR" output/*log
    $ grep -n "srun\|slurmstepd\|Traceback" output/*.e

Events
------
If your extension implements JADE structured log events then you may want to
view what events were logged.

JADE will also log any unhandled exceptions here.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ jade show-events
    $ jade show-events -c Error

Filtering jobs
--------------
You may want to debug a subset of the jobs.

Filter the first job into a new config file:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ jade config filter config.json 0 -o new_config.json

Filter ranges of indices of jobs into a new config file:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ jade config filter config.json :5 10:15 20 25 -o new_config.json

Deadlocks
---------
While it should be very rare, it is possible that JADE gets deadlocked and
stops submitting jobs. When a compute node finishes a batch of jobs it acquires
a file lock in order to update status and attempt to submit new jobs. This
should usually take at most a few seconds. If a walltime timeout occurs while
this lock is held and the JADE process is terminated then no other node will be
able to promote itself to submitter and jobs will be stuck.

We plan to add code to detect this condition in the future. If this occurs
you can fix it manually by deleting the lock file and restarting jobs. This is
safe if you know that no new jobs were submitted. It is unsafe if one or more
jobs were submitted but not recorded. Restarting the jobs could result in the
same jobs being run multiple times.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ rm <output-dir>/cluster_config.json.lock
    $ jade try-submit-jobs <output-dir>

Resource Monitoring
===================
JADE optionally monitors CPU, disk, memory, and network utilization
statistics in structured log events. There are two ways to collect statistics:

1. ``aggregation``: Track average/min/max stats in memory on each node and
   generate a summary report at the end (default).
2. ``periodic``: Record stats in files on each node and generate a summary
   report and interactive HTML plots at the end. The reports include
   average/min/max stats.

You can specify the mode in ``jade submit-jobs`` or ``jade config
submitter-params``. Note the short and long forms of the option.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ jade submit-jobs config.json --resource-monitor-type=aggregation
   $ jade submit-jobs config.json -R aggregation
   $ jade submit-jobs config.json --resource-monitor-type=periodic
   $ jade submit-jobs config.json -R periodic
   $ jade submit-jobs config.json --resource-monitor-type=none
   $ jade submit-jobs config.json -R none

The option ``--resource-monitor-interval`` or ``-r`` (in seconds) applies to both modes.

.. note:: The periodic mode can generate large files if the compute nodes
   run for a long time.

The default mode is ``aggregation`` in order to minimize storage consumption.

.. warning:: In order to preserve legacy behavior, if you specify
   ``--resource-monitor-interval`` but not ``resource-monitor-type``,
   ``periodic`` will be used. This may change in the future.

Both modes will generate ``<output-dir>/stats.txt`` and
``<output-dir>/stats_summary.json``.

If the ``periodic`` mode is enabled:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tree output/stats
    output/stats
    ├── CpuStatsViewer__resource_monitor_batch_0.html
    ├── DiskStatsViewer__resource_monitor_batch_0.html
    ├── MemoryStatsViewer__resource_monitor_batch_0.html
    └── NetworkStatsViewer__resource_monitor_batch_0.html

.. figure::  images/cpu.png

.. figure::  images/memory.png


Use this CLI command to view textual tables after a run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ jade stats show
    $ jade stats show cpu
    $ jade stats show disk
    $ jade stats show mem
    $ jade stats show net
    $ jade stats show --summary-only
    $ jade stats show --json-summary

.. note:: Reads and writes to the Lustre filesystem on the HPC are not tracked.

Use the ``--json-summary`` option if you want to programmatically analyze the
average/minimum/maximum stats for each metric type.

The stats can also be provided as pandas.DataFrame objects. For example, here
is how to view CPU stats for the node that ran the first batch:

.. code-block:: python

   from jade.events import EventsSummary, EVENT_NAME_CPU_STATS
   from jade.resource_monitor import CpuStatsViewer

   summary = EventsSummary("output")
   viewer = CpuStatsViewer(summary)
   for name in viewer.iter_batch_names():
       cpu_df = viewer.get_dataframe(name)
       print(cpu_df.head())

Standalone Resource Monitoring
------------------------------
The same resource monitoring functionality is available as a standalone script.
This can be useful to debug your application on your own system or in an interactive
session on a compute node. Here's how to do it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ jade stats collect --interval=1 --output=job-stats
    # Run your application in a separate terminal.
    # Press Ctrl-c when your application is finished.
    $ jade stats plot --output=job-stats
    2021-05-12 16:59:48,367 - INFO [jade.resource_monitor resource_monitor.py:226] : Generated plot in job-stats/stats/CpuStatsViewer__ResourceMonitor.html
